A Microbee developers graphics editor for PCG and screen stuff.

Written by I.Meins whilst coughing and spluttering with Covid in October 2022.

Some notes to get you going. Text entry in pygame is a dog so the filename entry field is very basic. Click in there to enter a file name and then load the PCG,Colour ram or video ram areas or save etc.

If you are editing a multi-character graphic then you can put the mouse over the character on the left of the
character you are going to edit in the pixel editor and press the L key, this will put the left most column of
pixels of that character in the shadow area on the left of the pixel editor and likewise if you press R it happens for the right most column of pixels. Soon the same will apply to the T (top) and B (bottom) rows. That makes it easier to align pixels as you edit.
